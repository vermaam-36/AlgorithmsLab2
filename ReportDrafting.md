#  Decision Rule  
Given a 100x100 2D plane. For any polygon with points {p1, p2...pn} n >= 3 and point m {x,y} 0 <= x <= 100, 0 <= y <= 100.  
Let 4 lines be drawn outward from point m, one horizontal vector reprsented as a line.  
If the vector touchs lines created by the polygon points {p1, p2...pn} and odd amount of times then the point m lies within the polygon  
else point m lies outside the polygon
